        <h1>Learn more about Google FLoC</h1>
        <p>FLoC is designed to replace 3rd patry cookies, which Google says it will ban in less than a year. The basic idea is to place users into small groups of like-minded people, and assign these groups an ID. Then, browsers will identify to advertisers and websites what 'cohorts', or groups, you're in, so they can target advertising to you. However, Google says it has no plans to add labels to these cohorts, so you, and advertisers, will have no clue what the cohorts you're in have in common. On paper this system sounds good - it's taking away a lot of data from advertisers, right? Well, it's not so easy. Cohorts are supposed to be "sufficiently large", but this piece of information is still very valuable in fingerprinting. By comparing FLoC identifiers, trackers now only have to compare your activity against the activity of a few thousand other users to determine which you are. There's also no guarantee that advertising companies won't be able to reverse engineer the algorithm that assigns users to cohorts. If they are able to identify how users get placed into a cohort, they can now say with almost complete certainty what any one user has done to be placed into it. Because cohorts are based on "user interest", this means that they can confirm exactly what the shared interest is. This is also another data point to make generalizations about a group with. An advertiser can look at a cohort and say that "<b>generally</b>, users in this cohort are LGBTQ+." Before, advertisers had to collect data, make generalizations, and place tons of cookies to identify a person's identity and interests. This could be blocked with relative ease, and was protected against in some counties by the GDPR. Now, Google is handing this data to advertisers on a silver platter. </p>
